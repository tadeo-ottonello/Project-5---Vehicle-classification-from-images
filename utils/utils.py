def get_class_names(config):
    """
    It's not always easy to track how Keras maps our dataset classes to
    the model outputs.
    Given an image, the model output will be a 1-D vector with probability
    scores for each class. The challenge is, how to map our class names to
    each score in the output vector.
    We will use this function to provide a class order to Keras and keep
    consistency between training and evaluation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : dict
        Experiment settings as Python dict.

    Returns
    -------
    classes : list
        List of classes as string.
        E.g. ['AM General Hummer SUV 2000', 'Buick Verano Sedan 2012',
                'FIAT 500 Abarth 2012', 'Jeep Patriot SUV 2012',

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder : str
        Path to the folder you want to walk.

    Returns
    -------
        For each file found, yields a tuple having the path to the file

    Walk through all the image files in a directory, loads them, applies
    the corresponding pre-processing and sends to the model to get
    predictions.

    This function will also return the true label for each image, to do so,
    the folder must be structured in a way in which images for the same
    category are grouped into a folder with the corresponding class
    name. This is the same data structure as we used for training our model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder : str
        Path to the folder you want to process.

    model : keras.Model
        Loaded keras model.

    input_size : tuple
        Keras model input size, we must resize the image to math these
        dimensions.

    class_names : list
        List of classes as string. It allow us to map model output IDs to the
        corresponding class name, e.g. 'Jeep Patriot SUV 2012'.

    Returns
    -------
    predictions, labels : tuple
        It will return two lists:
            - predictions: having the list of predicted labels by the model.
            - labels: is the list of the true labels, we will use them to
                      compare against model predictions.
